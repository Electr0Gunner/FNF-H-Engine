# Friday Night Funkin H-Engine

This is the repository for Friday Night Funkin H-Engine, a engine based on the original FNF source code meant to add features to make modding easier

This engine is still in development and more features will be added with time.

At the moment the curent build has some missing stages in some songs and some features are broken.
Those issues will be fixed

if you have feature ideas or you find bugs you can go on the Pull requests for Ideas and Issues for.. issues.

IF YOU MAKE A MOD AND DISTRIBUTE A MODIFIED / RECOMPILED VERSION, YOU MUST OPEN SOURCE YOUR MOD AS WELL
